### What's Up!

I'm Joseph, a third year Computer Engineering student at U of Toronto. I'm currently working on some projects with some orgs: [BGPC](https://github.com/bgpc-ca) and [saxle](https://github.com/saxle). I've spent the past summer learning AWS and TypeScript and I contributed to the [aws-serverless-toolkit](https://github.com/bgpc-ca/aws-serverless-toolkit) for which I'm making a [CLI](https://github.com/josephsawaya/aws-serverless-toolkit-cli) using Rust.
